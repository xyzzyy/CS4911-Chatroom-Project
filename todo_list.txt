-> fix the visual bug when sending messages that happens on every other client
-> fix how the server disconnect and exit works...
-> make a password attempt limit (both server-side and client-side)
-> make a max client count per ip (DDOS protection)
XX -> make it so multiple clients cannot log in as the same account
XX -> username length limit & username character map
XX -> implement last-seen on server-side (mark log out date, if logged in say "is online", else spit out time since logout date)
XX -> fully implement userlist & userlist command
XX -> all other commands
XX -> add more error handling (specifically for when server is offline)
XX? works on mininet ->  test actually hosting shit. make sure it works not just locally
-> make it so the server occasionally updates the last seen time for all online users

-> add /myip command that tells a user what their ip is.
-> add /me command for doing /me command things lol.
-> maybe add a /version command that tells a user what version their client is and what the latest is (assuming server is always updated)
