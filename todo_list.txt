-> implement commands. only the clear command currently works.
-> fix the visual bug when sending messages that happens on every other client
-> make a password attempt limit (both server-side and client-side)
-> make a max client count per ip (DDOS protection)
-> make it so multiple clients cannot log in as the same account
-> implement last-seen on server-side (mark log out date, if logged in say "is online", else spit out time since logout date)
-> fully implement userlist
-> add more error handling (specifically for when server is offline)
-> ** test actually hosting shit. make sure it works not just locally
